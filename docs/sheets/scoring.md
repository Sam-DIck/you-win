# Scoring

This sheet explains how to add some text to the screen, and how to keep a score.


## Text

When someone starts programming, it's traditional to for them to introduce themselves by saying "Hello world!". Let's do that now.

Create a `Text` object, and set its text.

```js
var label = new Text
label.text = "Hello world!"
```

## Text color

You can change the colour of text. The sort of colors you can use are the same ones we used to [00-new-world#change-the-background-colour](change the background colour) of the world. Instead of `world.background`, we use `label.fill`.

```js
label.fill = '#007de0'
```

ðŸ‘‰ Change it to your favourite color.


## Keeping Score

Our label has a `text` attribute, but we can't use that to keep score, because it's a `String` (a piece of text), rather than a number. If we try and add two strings together, they will be joined rather than mathematically summed!

You can try typing `'10' + '1'` in the Console to see what happens when you add two Strings. Compare it with `10 + 1` (adding two numbers).

So, let's make a separate variable which stores our score as a number.

```js
var score = 0
```

ðŸ‘‰ Add a score variable to the top of your program.


## Updating the score

You can update the score like you update any other number.

```js
  score += 1
```

ðŸ‘‰ Put this wherever you want to give the player a point.


## Displaying the score

We need to take what's in our score variable and display it on the screen. Let's create a Text object to show it.

```js
var scoreLabel = new Text
scoreLabel.text = "score: " + score
```

ðŸ‘‰ Put this at the top of your program, right after where you made the `score` variable.

You may notice the text doesn't update, even when you update the `score` variable. You'll need to write another line of code to update the text whenever the score changes:

```js
  score += 1
  scoreLabel.text = "score: " + score
```

ðŸ‘‰ Update the text whenever you give the player a point.


## High score

You can easily extend this to keep a high score as well:

* Create a `highScore` variable
* Use an `if` condition to update the `highScore` variable after you update the score
* Create a `highScoreLabel` to display it on the screen
* Use `localStorage` to save the high score, so it doesn't get forgotten when you refresh the page
