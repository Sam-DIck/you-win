# Overview

That's all the basics! You should now know the main things needed for every game.

You can now learn more about specific topics, depending on what you want to do. You can learn how to:

* [create lots of clones](cloning) of a sprite, for example firing a bullet when you tap, or making a new enemy every second
* [detect when sprites touch](collisions), for example to destroy a sprite when a bullet hits it
* have a sprite [bounce off the edges](bouncing) of the screen
* [scroll everything](scrolling) on the screen
* create [text or numbers](scoring), for example to show a score
* have a sprite [move at an angle](angles), or point toward something
