That's all the basics. You can now learn more about specific topics, depending on what you want to do. You can learn how to:

* have a sprite [bounce off the edges](bouncing) of the screen
* [create lots of clones](cloning) of a sprite, for example firing a bullet when you tap, or making a new enemy every second
* [detect when sprites touch](collisions), for example to destroy a sprite when a bullet hits it
* create [text or numbers](scoring), for example to show a score
* [scroll everything](scrolling) on the screen
