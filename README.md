The plan is to make a tutorial-style course for teaching JS/this lib.

For now, there's an [API Reference](sheets/Reference.md).


### Why "you-win"? ###

Because `game-over` was taken.


## Installing ##

  * Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
  * Make sure you have the latest version of NPM.

    ```sh
    $ npm install -g npm@5
    ```

  * Install `you-win` globally.

    ```sh
    $ npm install -g https://github.com/livewires/you-win.git
    ```


## Credits ##

* Emoji artwork provided by [EmojiOne](https://www.emojione.com/). A kid-friendly subset of emoji are included with the `you-win` dibstribution. The images are scaled down and palletised for compression and "retro" look. I believe this complies with the [Free License Agreement](https://d2gx6z0drfblcq.cloudfront.net/license-free.pdf).
* Included font Munro from [Ten by Twenty](http://tenbytwenty.com/?xxxx_posts=munro).
* Portions adapted from [nathan/phosphorus](https://github.com/nathan/phosphorus)
* `emitter.js` adapted from [nathan/v2](https://github.com/nathan/v2/blob/5ce1713a757a0b6993d003b532072bc093598860/emitter.js)
* Descended from [livewires/run-game](https://github.com/livewires/run-game) and the [Livewires Python Course](https://github.com/livewires/python)
